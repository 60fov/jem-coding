brain dump post floppy box
---
m felt that she learned 50%, interested and engaged throughout but bc floppy box is kind of a boring game to start with a bit less enthusiastic

time est 8-9 over 3 times

game polish remaining
    - art
    - world object
    - sound
    - game states (unfinished)
    - scoring
    - scaling (difficulty)

want layers of abstraction

- raw (literally js)
- base (library, eg collision, sprite loading, sfx_helpers)
- specific (library for floppy box, eg create_bird(), )
